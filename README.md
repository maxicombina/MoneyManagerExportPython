# MoneyManagerExportPython

This tool extracts data from a backup file of the Money Manager Expense & Budget app for iOS/Android.
It creates a CSV file with a format that is suitable for me :)

This is an adaptation of https://github.com/maxicombina/MoneyMeExportPython.
I could have done a more pro implementation, as they are very similar tools. But I only need a quick hack right now.
